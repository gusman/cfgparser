# CfgParser

This is only another approach in parsing semi structured data
of a config NOS config file. Currently, CfgParser only supports
2 Network Operating System (NOS) config file which are Nokia Classic
and Cisco IOS XE. The motivation of this CfgParser is as proof of concept
to develop a NOS config file parser using tokenization and parser tree methodology.
