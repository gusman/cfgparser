# CfgParser

## Introduction

This is only another approach in parsing semi structured data
of a NOS config file. The motivation of this CfgParser is as a proof of concept
to develop a NOS config file parser using tokenization and parser tree methodology.
Currently, CfgParser only supports 2 Network Operating System (NOS) config file types 
which are Nokia Classic and Cisco IOS XE.
